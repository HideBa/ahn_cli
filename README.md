```shell
Options:
 -c, --city <city_name>        Download point cloud data for the specified city.
 -o, --output <file>           Designate the output file for the downloaded data.
 -i, --include-class <class>   Include specific point cloud classes in the download,
                               specified in a comma-separated list. Available classes:
                               0:Created, never classified; 1:Unclassified; 2:Ground;
                               6:Building; 9:Water; 14:High tension; 26:Civil structure.
 -e, --exclude-class <class>   Exclude specific point cloud classes from the download,
                               specified in a comma-separated list. Available classes as above.
 -d, --decimate <step>         Decimate the point cloud data by the specified step.
 -ncc, --no-clip-city          Avoid clipping the point cloud data to the city boundary.
 -cf, --clip-file <file>       Provide a file path for a clipping boundary file to clip
                               the point cloud data to a specified area.
 -e, --epsg <epsg>             Set the EPSG code for user's clip file.
 -b, --bbox <bbox>             Specify a bounding box to clip the point cloud data. It should be comma-separated list with minx,miny,maxx,maxy
                               centered on the city polygon.
 -p, --preview                 Preview the point cloud data in a 3D viewer.

### Usage Examples

**Download Point Cloud Data for Delft with All Classification Classes:**

```
ahn_cli -c delft -o ./delft.laz
```

**To Include or Exclude Specific Classes:**

```
ahn_cli -c delft -o ./delft.laz -i 1,2
```

**For Non-Clipped, Rectangular-Shaped Data:**

```
ahn_cli -c delft -o ./delft.laz -i 1,2 -ncc
```

**To Decimate City-Scale Point Cloud Data:**

```
ahn_cli -c delft -o ./delft.laz -i 1,2 -d 2
```

**Specify a Bounding box for clipping:**

If you specify a `b`, it will clip the point cloud data with specified bounding box.
```
ahn_cli -o ./delft.laz -i 1,2 -b 194198.0,443461.0,194594.0,443694.0
```
